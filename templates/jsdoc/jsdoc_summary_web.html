This JavaScript library enables any JavaScript application running in a web browser to connect to any MQTT broker via PRODUCT_JSNAME_PLACEHOLDER. A different library, specific for Node.js, is available on NPM.

<p>The library is designed to be formally equivalent to the {@link https://www.eclipse.org/paho/clients/js/|Eclipse Paho JavaScript Client} as
  much as possible, even if some differences still apply, especially for what concerns the usage of namespaces and the way a connection to the broker is established.

<p>
Following is an example showing some basic operations, such as getting a connection,
subscribing to a topic and publishing a message:

<pre>
// Connect to the PRODUCT_JSNAME_PLACEHOLDER server hosted at 'my.push.server' and listening on tcp port 8080.
mqttcool.openSession('http://my.PRODUCT_JSNAME_PLACEHOLDER.server:8080', 'my_user', 'my_password', {

  onConnectionSuccess: function(mqttCoolSession) {

    // Get a client instance, which will connect to the MQTT broker mapped by
    // the alias "my_mqtt_broker" using the clientId 'my_client_id'.
    var client = mqttCoolSession.createClient('my_mqtt_broker', 'my_client_id');

    // Set function callbacks.
    client.onConnectionLost = onConnectionLost;
    client.onMessageArrived = onMessageArrived;

    // Connect to the MQTT broker.
    client.connect( { onSuccess: onConnect } );

    // Called when the connection has been successfully acknowledged.
    function onConnect() {
      console.log("onConnect");
      // Subscribe to the topic '/World'
      client.subscribe("/World");

      // Publish the message 'Hello' to the topic '/World'.
      message = new Message("Hello");
      message.destinationName = "/World";
      client.send(message);
    }

    // Called when the client loses its connection.
    function onConnectionLost(responseObject) {
      if (responseObject.errorCode !== 0) {
        console.log("onConnectionLost:" + responseObject.errorMessage);
      }
    }

    // Called upon receiving a message.
    function onMessageArrived(message) {
      console.log("onMessageArrived:" + message.payloadString);
    }
  }
});
</pre>
